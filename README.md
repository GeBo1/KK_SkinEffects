# KK_SkinEffects / Additional Skin Effects mod for Koikatsu!
Koikatu! mod that adds simple effects to characters' skin that are not present in the main game. The effects include sweating, wetness under shower, bukkake etc. The effects are implemented by static textures with multiple levels, they are not animated. The effects are automatically applied during gameplay, and can be used in studio in your scenes.

Note: Level of the virgin effect during 1st time depends on the girl's parameters. Some girls might not have the effect at all.
